-----Initial Release-----

-----Finding the right textures and Materials-----

Every folder located in this package, has been sorted appropriately.

*For every folder Named: "1, 2, 3, or 4," they all share the corresponding
texture Materials called "Utility Map" and their number.
For all of the Folders Named: "1," and "2," they both have two alternate texture
looks with caution line Materials called: "Utility_Map_1B," and "Utility_Map_2B."

Giving 75% of all models the possibility for up to 6 different texture looks!

*There are about a dozen different glass Materials, each named appropriately:
Glass 1, Glass 2, etc.. Shiny Glass 1, Shiny Glass 2, etc..
